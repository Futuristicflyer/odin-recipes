        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pound sirloin steak (cut into bite size pieces)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon parsley</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the olive oil to a large skillet and heat it over high heat. Make sure the olive oil is hot, then add the steak pieces to it. Season
                them generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook for at least 2 minutes before stirring the steak pieces. You want to make sure you get a good sear on them. Continue cooking for 
                another 2 minutes until they're golden brown. If your skillet isn't big enough, you may need to do this batches.</li>
            <li>Transfer the steak bites to a plate and in the same skillet add the butter. Turn the heat down to a medium and after the butter has 
                melted, add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook for about 30 seconds while stirring, just until the garlic becomes aromatic and starts 
                to brown.</li>
            <li>Pour the garlic butter over the steak bites and toss well. Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
        </ol>
